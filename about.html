    <h1>What is SkullKing?</h1>
    <p>
        Skull King is a trick-taking game in which you will bid
        the exact number of tricks you predict you will win each
        round. You'll battle with your rivals as you strive to keep
        your own bid afloatâ€¦ while seizing opportunities to also
        sink your opponents! The pirate with the highest score at
        the end of the game wins and earns the title of Captain of
        the Seven Seas!
    </p>
    <h1><a href="https://www.grandpabecksgames.com/pages/skull-king" >How to Play</a></h1>
    <h3>Set Up</h3>
    <p>
        Distribute the player aid cards and a set of bid reminder
        cards to each player. Place any remaining player aids and
        bid cards in the box. Now shuffle the deck and prepare
        yerselves fer battle!
    </p>
    <h3>On Your Turn</h3>
    <p>
        Once bidding is complete, the player to the left of the
        dealer leads out the first trick by playing a card face up
        in the center of the table. In clockwise order, each other
        player plays a card following the rules outlined in the
        previous sections.
        The person who played the highest-ranking card wins the
        trick, gathers the cards into a stack, and places the stack in
        front of them. Then, they play a card to lead the next trick.
        Play continues until all the tricks in that round have been
        played. Tally each player's score, including any bonus
        points earned, on the scorepad.
        The player to the dealer's left becomes the new dealer.
        This player shuffles all cards, including the ones played in
        the previous round, and then deals them, increasing the
        number of cards dealt by 1 from the previous round.
        After the tenth round is completed, final scores are tallied,
        the player with the highest score is declared the victor and
        is appointed as the pirate captain of the seven seas!
